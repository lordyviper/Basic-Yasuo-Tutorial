### Basic-Yasuo-Tutorial

Hello everyone, in this article I will tell you as much as possible about Yasuo's abilities, combinations, pairings and life.

First of all, let me tell you briefly about his life.
###Yasuo's life 
A deeply determined Ionian, Yasuo is an agile swordsman who uses the air against his foes. As a proud youth, he wrongly accused him of murdering his master - unable to prove his innocence, he had to kill his own brother in self-defense. Even after his master's true murderer was revealed, Yasuo still couldn't forgive himself for everything he had done.

Now let's talk about the skill set and combos.
###Skill set

WAY OF THE WANDERER
Yasuo's Critical Strike Chance is increased. Additionally, Yasuo builds toward a shield whenever he is moving. The shield triggers when he takes damage from a champion or monster. 


Q
STEEL TEMPEST
Thrusts forward, damaging all enemies in a line. On hit, grants a stack of Gathering Storm for a few seconds. At 2 stacks, Steel Tempest fires a whirlwind that knocks Airborne. Steel Tempest is treated as a basic attack and scales with all the same things.

W
WIND WALL
Creates a moving wall that blocks all enemy projectiles for 4 seconds.

E
SWEEPING BLADE
Dashes through target enemy, dealing magic damage. Each cast increases your next dash's base Damage, up to a max amount. Cannot be re-cast on the same enemy for a few seconds. If Steel Tempest is cast while dashing, it will strike as a circle.

R
LAST BREATH
Blinks to an Airborne enemy champion, dealing physical damage and holding all Airborne enemies in the area in the air. Grants maximum Flow but resets all stacks of Gathering Storm. For a moderate time afterwards, Yasuo's critical strikes gain significant Bonus Armor Penetration.
